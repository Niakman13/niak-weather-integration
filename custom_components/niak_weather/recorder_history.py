"""Compact reads of the recorder: what the learning needs from ten days of history, never all of it in memory at once.

A sensor reporting every ten seconds leaves ~86 000 rows in ten days. They are read one entity and one day at a time,
and only what the analyses use is kept: every change of a contact or a state, for a thermostat the moments its
`hvac_action` changes, and for a measure every real move (1 % or more) but its small jitter once a minute at most.
A CO₂ sensor reporting in bursts while a window is open keeps its whole fall: that is what the airing model reads.
Runs in the recorder's executor (blocking database calls).

Copied unchanged into each brick from niak-ecosysteme/socle/ (copier.sh), like socle.py.
