"""The integration's former technical name, gathered here and nowhere else.

Hestia Weather was first published under another technical name. A home installed then keeps that name in its
configuration entries, .storage files, dashboards and automations: domain_migration.py carries all of it over to
« hestia_weather » at the first start, then removes the old entries. These constants are only what it needs to find them.
They also let an existing home keep the entity ids it already has (sensor.<ENTITY_ROOT>_ressenti), and the optional
renaming tool of the settings (migration.py) offer the new ones. No other module writes an old name.
