"""A home installed under a brick's former technical name is carried over to its Hestia name, once, at the first start.

Copied unchanged into each brick from hestia-ecosysteme/socle/ (copier.sh), like socle.py. The brick's former names
are in its engine/legacy.py, the only module that writes them.

Nothing the user has is lost:
1. each former config entry becomes a new one, with its title, data, options, unique id and preferences. The entities
   and devices follow, with their ids, names, areas and icons. Entity ids do not change: history and long-term
   statistics stay attached to them;
2. the brick's .storage files (learning, alerts…) are copied under the new name;
3. what the interface wrote (automations, scripts, scenes, dashboards, other integrations' options, blueprints imported
   from this brick) is updated. YAML written by hand is never rewritten: a repair lists its files and lines;
4. only then are the former entries removed, and the former folder custom_components/<former domain> when it is this
   brick's own: two copies are never loaded side by side.
Entry ids change with the entries. A shared table (.storage/hestia_migration) keeps which new id each former one took,
so that every brick can mend what points to another brick's entry (Hestia Confort's link to a Hestia Weather place).
A run cut short starts again where it stopped at the next start: the table says which entries already exist.
